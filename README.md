# top_rated_250_imdb_TV_shows:
### in this notebook, I got the top rated 250 tv shows on IMDb by using requests, and BeautifulSoup modules for getting the html structure and parse and search via html structure text getting the  rank, show name, IMDb page link,	IMDb rating,	# of ratings, genre, airing years, rating system,	top casts
### by getting a specified feature for the first show and then make a function that gets the same feature for the all 250 shows 
### in the end, I made one function that get all the above features for the all 250 shows, which takes about the same amount of time for a function that get just one feature for the all 250 shows
